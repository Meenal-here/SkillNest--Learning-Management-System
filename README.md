# SkillNest – Learning Management Platform

SkillNest is a web-based Learning Management System developed as part of my Advanced Java practice project to strengthen my backend development, database management, and object-oriented programming skills. The platform is designed using Core Java, Servlets, JSP, and JDBC, following an MVC-based structure to maintain clean separation between logic, presentation, and data access layers. It showcases a complete CRUD-based workflow and emphasizes modular, maintainable code using OOP concepts and ArrayLists for dynamic data handling.

<b>The system includes three core modules — Admin, Teacher, and Student — each with distinct roles and functionalities.</b>

The Student Module enables students to register, update their profile, enroll in available courses, and view enrolled course details.

The Teacher Module allows teachers to register, update their profile, post and manage courses, and view lists of enrolled students.

The Admin Module provides administrative control to manage all users and courses, with the ability to add, update, or delete teacher and student records.

SkillNest was built using<b> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap</b> for the front end and<b> MySQL</b> for data persistence. The project reflects my ability to integrate backend and frontend technologies effectively, apply <b>core Java concepts</b>, and build a fully functional role-based web application from scratch — serving as a strong demonstration of my hands-on skills in<b> Advanced Java and web development</b>.
